Simple, responsive restaurant landing page built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

This repository is a small, dependency-free front-end project that demonstrates layout, responsive design, and basic interactivity suitable for a portfolio.

## Features

- Mobile-first responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Menu sections and image gallery
- Lightweight JavaScript for simple UI interactions

## Project structure

```
index.html
style.css

images/
```

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1. Clone the repo:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Sivatheevan1224/Restaurant-Website.git
cd "Restaurant-Website"
```

2. Open locally:

- Option A: Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with > Browser).
- Option B: Serve with a simple static server (recommended for certain features):

```powershell
# If you have Python 3 installed
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000

# Or use Node's http-server if installed
npx http-server -p 8000
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and set the source to the `main` branch (root).
3. Your site should become available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/Restaurant-Website/`.

## Customize

- Replace images in the `images/` folder and update `index.html` as needed.

If you want, I can add an automated GitHub Pages deploy workflow or a short snippet to import a screenshot into a React/Vite portfolio.
